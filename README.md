# Horiseon-Code-Refactor: HTML, CSS, and Git:

## Description

We completed the request of the client which was to follow accessibility standards in order to have their site optimized for performance.
CSS style plays an integral role in bringing to life the HTML page. Having proper structure and clean code while combining the same
CSS selectors and styles into one catergory makes it easier to read.
