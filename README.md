# Horiseon-Code-Refactor: HTML, CSS, and Git: 
We completed the request of the client which was to follow accessibility standards in order to have their site optimized for performance.
CSS style plays an integral role in bringing to life the HTML page. Having proper structure and clean code while combining the same
CSS selectors and styles into one catergory makes it easier to read.

## Installation
The code was already in place. I followed the Scout Rule Which was to clean up and organize the code. Updated the
code to a better format and structure which will make it more accessable and easier for the next developer to look
at my code and work.
